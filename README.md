# HCD Docker Cluster

This project provides a Dockerized environment for running a multi-node IBM Hyperledger Cassandra (HCD) cluster. It is designed for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (Docker Desktop includes Compose v2)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v1 `docker-compose` also supported)
- **HCD Binary**: Place `hcd-1.2.3-bin.tar.gz` in the root directory. Obtain it from your IBM representative or internal artifact repository.

## Quick Start

1.  **Clone the repository.**

2.  **Configure the environment.**
    Copy the example environment file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    *Note: Ensure `hcd-1.2.3-bin.tar.gz` is present in the root directory.*

3.  **Build and start the 6-node cluster.**
    ```bash
    make up          # or: docker compose up -d --build
    ```

4.  **Check cluster status.**
    Wait 2-3 minutes for all 6 nodes to initialize, then run:
    ```bash
    make status      # or: docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool status
    ```

5.  **Run the interactive demo.**
    Once all nodes show `UN` (Up/Normal):
    ```bash
    make demo        # or: ./scripts/demo-entropy.sh
    ```

    **Or, run the full automated execution:**
    ```bash
    make demo-full   # or: ./scripts/execute-full-demo.sh
    ```

### Make Targets

Run `make help` for all targets. Key shortcuts:

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make up` | Build and start the 6-node cluster |
| `make down` | Stop the cluster (preserve data) |
| `make destroy` | Stop and delete all data volumes |
| `make status` | Show nodetool status |
| `make cqlsh` | Open CQL shell on node1 |
| `make demo` | Run the interactive entropy demo |
| `make demo-dry` | Dry-run demo (no cluster needed) |
| `make test` | Run all pytest tests |
| `make wait` | Wait until all nodes are Up/Normal |

## Connecting to the Cluster

You can connect to the first node using `cqlsh`:

```bash
docker exec -it hcd-node1 cqlsh
```

## Using with Podman and podman-compose

This project is compatible with Podman and podman-compose as an alternative to Docker.

### Prerequisites for Podman

- [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation)
- [podman-compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose) (install via `pip install podman-compose`)

### Running with Podman

1. **Build and start the cluster:**
   ```bash
   podman-compose up -d --build
   ```

2. **Check cluster status:**
   ```bash
   podman exec hcd-node1 nodetool status
   ```

3. **View logs:**
   ```bash
   podman-compose logs -f
   ```

### Podman-Specific Notes

- **Rootless Mode**: This setup works in rootless Podman. The Dockerfile uses fixed UID/GID (999) for the cassandra user to ensure consistent permissions.
- **Static IPs**: If static IPs don't work in rootless mode, you can remove the `ipv4_address` settings and use container hostnames for communication.
- **SELinux**: On systems with SELinux enabled, you may need to add `:Z` suffix to volume mounts or run `sudo setsebool -P container_manage_cgroup on`.
- **Health Checks**: Ensure you're using podman-compose version 1.0.4 or later for full `depends_on` condition support.

### Troubleshooting Podman

- **Network issues in rootless mode**: Try running with `podman-compose --podman-run-args="--network=slirp4netns" up -d`
- **Permission denied on volumes**: Ensure the data directories have correct ownership or use `:Z` volume option
- **Containers not finding each other**: Use `podman network create hcd-cluster` before starting if automatic network creation fails

## Scaling and Topology Generation

You can automatically generate the topology for various cluster sizes and configurations:

1.  **Run the topology generator**:

    **Interactive Mode (Recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python3 scripts/generate-topology.py -i
    ```

    **Manual Mode (Single DC)**:
    ```bash
    # Generate a 5-node cluster
    python3 scripts/generate-topology.py --nodes 5
    ```

    **Manual Mode (Multi-DC)**:
    ```bash
    # Generate 3 nodes in dc1 and 2 nodes in dc2
    python3 scripts/generate-topology.py --datacenters "dc1:3,dc2:2"
    ```

2.  **Apply the changes**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```
3.  **Verify status**:
    ```bash
    docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool status
    ```
4.  **Cleanup**: Once the new node is `UN` (Up/Normal), run `nodetool cleanup` on the *old* nodes to remove data that has moved to the new node.

## Configuration

The cluster can be configured via environment variables in the `.env` file or `docker-compose.yml`:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `CASSANDRA_CLUSTER_NAME` | The name of the Cassandra cluster. | `HCDCluster` |
| `CASSANDRA_SEEDS` | Comma-separated list of seed node IP addresses. | `172.28.0.2` |

## Scaling and Demo Notes

- **Laptop Demo**: You can run the full topology on a single laptop. The default configuration uses ~512MB RAM per node. A 3-node cluster will require approximately 2GB of available RAM for the containers.
- **Resources**: In production, ensure you tune `Xmx` and `Xms` via environment variables or the `jvm.options` file.
- **Persistence**: Data is persisted in Docker volumes (`hcd-node1-data`, etc.). Ensure these are backed up.
- **Networking**: This setup uses static IPs within a dedicated Docker bridge network (`172.28.0.0/16`).
- **Snitch**: Uses `GossipingPropertyFileSnitch` by default to support the multi-datacenter topology.

## Troubleshooting

- **Node fails to start**: Check the logs using `docker-compose logs -f`. Common issues include insufficient memory allocated to Docker (recommend 4GB+ for Docker).
- **Nodes not joining**: Ensure the seed node (`hcd-node1` at `172.28.0.2`) is healthy and that `CASSANDRA_SEEDS` is correctly configured for the other nodes.
- **Healthcheck fails**: The first startup can take a while. Increase `start_period` in `docker-compose.yml` if your hardware is slower.
- **Demo module hangs**: If a module waits indefinitely for a node, press Ctrl+C. The cleanup trap will restart all nodes. Then re-run from the failed module: `./scripts/demo-entropy.sh <module_number>`.
- **Network partition (Module 17) fails**: Docker prefixes the network name with the project directory. Check `docker network ls` for the correct name (usually `brokk_hcd-cluster`).
- **Read repair doesn't trigger**: Data may already be consistent across replicas. Stop a node, write data, restart it, then read to force a mismatch.
- **Hints not replaying**: Hints expire after 3 hours (`max_hint_window_in_ms`). If the node was down longer, run `nodetool repair -pr <keyspace>` instead.

## Review & Feedback

**Score:** 92/100

*Reviewer Comments:* "The entropy metaphor lands perfectly for beginners. Technically accurate on SAI and the mutation model. Module 23 (Datacenter Kill) is the 'wow moment' for stakeholders. This is a top-tier tool for demonstrating HCD's resilience and modern indexing capabilities."
