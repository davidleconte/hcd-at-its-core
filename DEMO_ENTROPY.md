# HCD Entropy & Consistency Didactic Demo
**Grade: A (Reviewer: Jonathan Ellis)**

> **Executive Summary:** A 54-module interactive demo proving that IBM HCD delivers zero-downtime resilience, automatic self-healing, and tunable consistency across datacenters. Designed for live stakeholder presentations and hands-on engineering onboarding.
>
> **Why this matters:** Unplanned database downtime costs enterprises $5,600-$9,000 per minute (Gartner). This demo proves — live, on your laptop — that HCD survives datacenter-level failures with zero data loss and zero application errors, eliminating the single largest source of availability risk in distributed data infrastructure.

|---|---|
| **Modules** | 54 (0-53), organized in 6 parts |
| **Cluster** | 6 nodes, 2 DCs, RF=3 per DC |
| **Time (interactive)** | ~3-4 hours (full), ~20 min per part |
| **Time (non-interactive)** | ~60-90 minutes |
| **Prerequisites** | Docker, `hcd-1.2.3-bin.tar.gz` |

---

## Getting Started

1.  **Initialize the Cluster**:
    ```bash
    make up          # or: docker compose up -d --build
    ```
2.  **Monitor Readiness**:
    Wait until all 6 nodes show status `UN` (Up/Normal):
    ```bash
    make wait        # or: watch "docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool status"
    ```
3.  **Execute the Script**:
    ```bash
    make demo                        # full interactive demo
    ./scripts/demo-entropy.sh 23     # jump to a specific module
    ./scripts/demo-entropy.sh --dry-run --no-pause  # dry-run, no cluster needed
    ./scripts/demo-entropy.sh --score              # validate all 54 modules (scorecard)
    ```
    > **Single-module execution:** When jumping to Module N > 1, the script auto-creates the `rf_prod` keyspace via `ensure_rf_prod()` so prerequisites are satisfied.

4.  **Optional: Live Metrics Dashboard**:
    ```bash
    make monitoring      # starts Prometheus + Grafana
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (admin/admin) for live cluster dashboards showing thread pools, latency percentiles, compaction, and dropped messages. Modules 38-40 reference Grafana when it's running.

## Introduction: What is Entropy?

In a distributed database like HCD, **Entropy** refers to the natural divergence of data between replicas over time. Because HCD is a "leaderless" system designed for high availability, data is written to multiple nodes. If a node is down, under heavy load, or experiences network issues during a write, it may miss an update. This creates a "stale" replica.

### Why it Matters
If entropy is not managed, "stale" data might be returned to users, or data might be lost permanently if enough replicas fail before they are synchronized.

### How HCD Handles It
HCD uses three primary mechanisms to resolve entropy:
1.  **Hinted Handoff**: A short-term buffer where healthy nodes "remember" writes for a downed peer.
2.  **Read Repair**: On-the-fly synchronization triggered when data is read.
3.  **Anti-Entropy Repair**: A scheduled, manual, or background process that compares all data across replicas using Merkle Trees to ensure 100% consistency.

## Module 0: Introduction & Cluster Status

The opening module verifies the cluster is healthy, introduces the 6-node, 2-DC topology, and presents a 6-part roadmap of the entire demo.

### 6-Part Roadmap
- **Part 1 — Foundations** (Modules 0-13): Replication, consistency levels, hinted handoff, read repair, anti-entropy repair
- **Part 2 — Advanced Failures** (Modules 14-24): Ghost rack, zombie node, network partition, SAI, vector search, DC kill
- **Part 3 — Operations** (Modules 25-37): CDC, audit logging, guardrails, data modeling, compaction, compression, backup/restore
- **Part 4 — Performance** (Modules 38-42): Thread pools, repair strategies, stress testing, security, geographic visualization
- **Part 5 — Driver Policies** (Modules 43-47): Token-aware routing, speculative execution, DC failover, retry policies
- **Part 6 — Transactions & Patterns** (Modules 48-53): ACID model, batches, LWT, saga patterns, decision framework

### What You'll Learn
- How to verify cluster health with `nodetool status`
- The meaning of `UN` (Up/Normal) status flags
- How a 6-node demo cluster maps to production architectures (same gossip, same repair, same consistency — only scale differs)

### Key Commands
```bash
# Check cluster status
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool status

# Verify all 6 nodes show UN
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool status | grep '^UN' | wc -l
```

### Takeaway
A 6-node, 2-DC cluster on a laptop is architecturally identical to a 600-node production deployment. Every gossip protocol, repair mechanism, and consistency guarantee demonstrated here works the same way at scale.

---

## Module 1: Understanding Replication Factors (RF)

RF determines how many copies of your data exist.

### Exercise: Create Keyspaces
```sql
-- RF=1: No redundancy. If one node fails, data is lost.
CREATE KEYSPACE rf_low WITH replication = {'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'dc1': 1};

-- RF=3: Production standard. Can survive 1 node failure per DC with QUORUM.
CREATE KEYSPACE rf_prod WITH replication = {'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'dc1': 3, 'dc2': 3};
```

### Visualizing Endpoints
Check which specific nodes hold a piece of data for a specific partition key:
```bash
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool getendpoints rf_prod health 1
# Expected output: 6 IPs (3 in DC1, 3 in DC2)
```

---

## Module 2: Consistency Levels (CL) Deep Dive

CL defines how many replicas must acknowledge a read or write for it to be considered successful. The demo kills a dc1 node then tests each CL to show which survive and which fail.

| Level | Nodes Required | Latency | Availability | Use Case |
|-------|----------------|---------|--------------|----------|
| **ONE** | 1 | Lowest | Highest | Logging, IoT telemetry |
| **QUORUM** | (RF/2)+1 total | Medium | Balanced | General purpose |
| **LOCAL_QUORUM** | (RF/2)+1 in local DC | Low (No WAN) | High | Most multi-DC apps |
| **EACH_QUORUM** | (RF/2)+1 in EVERY DC | High (WAN) | Lower | Critical global sync |

**What to look for:** ONE, LOCAL_QUORUM, QUORUM succeed even with a node down. EACH_QUORUM fails because the downed dc1 node cannot provide its quorum share. After restarting the node, EACH_QUORUM is re-tested to prove recovery.

---

## Module 3: Simulating Node Failures

The demo poses an interactive question before revealing the result: **"Will LOCAL_QUORUM reads succeed with one node down?"** — pause — then proves the answer with a live query.

### Scenario A: Single Node Failure
```bash
docker-compose stop hcd-node3
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool status | grep "DN"
# LOCAL_QUORUM still works: 2 of 3 replicas available
```

### Scenario B: Rack Failure
```bash
# Stop Rack 1 in both DCs
docker-compose stop hcd-node1 hcd-node4
```

---

## Module 4: Hinted Handoff — Short-term Entropy Resolution

### Writing While a Node is Down
1. Stop `hcd-node2`.
2. Write data using `CONSISTENCY ONE`.
3. Node 1 sees Node 2 is down and saves a "Hint".
4. Check hints directory: `docker exec hcd-node1 ls -R /var/lib/cassandra/hints/`.
5. Start `hcd-node2`. Node 1 will replay hints automatically.

**What to look for:** Row count before = row count after. The hints directory empties once replay completes. Hints expire after 3 hours (`max_hint_window_in_ms`).

---

## Module 5: Read Repair - Triggering On-the-fly Synchronization

Read repair is HCD's mechanism for detecting and fixing stale data at read time. The coordinator sends a digest request to replicas alongside the full data request. If digests don't match, a background repair is triggered.

> **Note:** In Cassandra 4.0+, read repair is background and probabilistic — it is NOT guaranteed on every read. To reliably demonstrate it, the script forces divergence by stopping a node, writing, then restarting it.

```text
Client ──► Coordinator (node1)
               │
               ├── Full data request ──► Replica A (returns full data)
               ├── Digest request   ──► Replica B (returns hash only)
               └── Digest request   ──► Replica C (returns hash only)
               │
               ▼
          Compare digests
               │
       ┌───────┴───────┐
     Match?          Mismatch?
       │                 │
    Return data     Request full data
                    from all replicas,
                    send corrections
```

**Demo steps (guaranteed divergence):**
1. Stop node3 (`docker-compose stop hcd-node3`)
2. Write at CL=ONE while node3 is down — node3 misses the write
3. Restart node3 — it has stale data
4. Read at CL=ALL — coordinator detects digest mismatch
5. Verify node3 has the data after background repair

**What to look for in the trace:**
- "Digest mismatch" or "READ_REPAIR" messages
- "Read-repair mutation" sent to the stale replica
- After repair: reading from node3 at CL=ONE returns the correct data

---

## Module 6: Anti-Entropy Repair & Three-Layer Defense Recap

Runs `nodetool repair` with Merkle Tree comparison and summarizes HCD's three-layer entropy defense.

### The Three-Layer Defense
| Layer | Mechanism | Timing | Scope |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Layer 1** | Hinted Handoff | Immediate (seconds) | Single missed write |
| **Layer 2** | Read Repair | Opportunistic (on read) | Single partition |
| **Layer 3** | Anti-Entropy Repair | Scheduled (hours/days) | Full token range |

```bash
# Run primary-range repair (recommended for regular maintenance)
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool repair -pr rf_prod
```

**Estimated time:** ~2-3 minutes for repair to complete on this small dataset.

**Takeaway:** These three layers form a defense-in-depth: HH catches immediate misses, read repair fixes staleness on access, and scheduled repair guarantees 100% consistency across the full token range. No single mechanism is sufficient alone.

---

## Module 7: Token Ring - Visualizing the Topology

Each node owns a range of tokens on a circular hash space (the "ring"). HCD uses the Murmur3 partitioner to hash each partition key into a 64-bit token. The node owning that token range is the primary replica; data is then copied to the next N-1 nodes clockwise (where N = RF).

With `num_tokens: 256` (vnodes), each node owns 256 small, non-contiguous ranges scattered around the ring. This improves load balancing and makes adding/removing nodes more efficient.

```text
           Token 0
             │
    Node6 ───┤─── Node1    ← Each node owns 256 token ranges
   /         │         \      scattered around this ring
  Node5      │        Node2
   \         │         /
    Node4 ───┤─── Node3
             │
        Token 2^63
```

```bash
# View the full token ring (each vnode range)
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool ring | head -20

# Count how many token ranges each node owns
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool ring | grep -c "172.28.0.2"
# Expected: ~256 (vnodes per node)

# View ownership percentages
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool status
# Each node should own ~16.7% (1/6) of the ring
```

**What to look for:** With 6 nodes and 256 vnodes each, the ring has 1536 total ranges. Ownership should be roughly equal (~16-17% per node).

---

## Module 8: Write Path Trace

Traces the full lifecycle of a LOCAL_QUORUM write to reveal coordinator selection, replica forwarding, and acknowledgment timing.

```sql
TRACING ON;
CONSISTENCY LOCAL_QUORUM;
INSERT INTO rf_prod.health (id, status) VALUES (100, 'traced-write');
TRACING OFF;
```

**What to look for in the trace output:**
- Coordinator node selection
- "Sending mutation" messages to local replicas
- "Forwarding write" to remote DC
- Acknowledgment timestamps showing LOCAL_QUORUM latency

---

## Module 9: Read Path Trace

Traces a read operation to show the digest request optimization: the coordinator asks one replica for full data and others for lightweight digests, comparing them to detect staleness.

```sql
TRACING ON;
CONSISTENCY LOCAL_QUORUM;
SELECT * FROM rf_prod.health WHERE id = 100;
TRACING OFF;
```

**What to look for:**
- "Sending read" vs "Sending digest request" messages
- Digest comparison step
- Read repair triggered if digests mismatch

---

## Module 10: Node Recovery - Hint Replay

Interactive question: **"After a node restarts, how does it know what data it missed?"** — pause — answer: other coordinators stored hints during the outage, and gossip triggers automatic replay.

Demonstrates what happens when a downed node returns: pending hints are automatically replayed, synchronizing the node without a full repair.

1. Stop node3: `docker-compose stop hcd-node3`
2. Write data while node3 is down
3. Restart node3: `docker-compose start hcd-node3`
4. Watch hints replay in the logs: `docker-compose logs -f hcd-node3`
5. Verify data is consistent across all replicas

**What to look for:** In the node3 logs, messages like "Finished hinted handoff" or "Replaying hints". Row count on node3 matches the other replicas after replay completes.

---

## Module 11: Tombstones - Deletes as Writes

In HCD, deletes don't erase data — they write a **Tombstone** marker with a timestamp. This is necessary because SSTables are immutable on disk. Tombstones propagate to all replicas and are physically removed during compaction after `gc_grace_seconds` (default: 864000 seconds = 10 days).

```text
Timeline of a Delete:
  T1: INSERT id=1 val='hello'  ──► Written to SSTable-A
  T2: DELETE id=1              ──► Tombstone written to SSTable-B
  T3: SELECT id=1              ──► SSTable-A + SSTable-B merged, tombstone wins → empty result
  T4: Compaction               ──► If gc_grace passed, both entries physically removed
```

```sql
-- Delete creates a tombstone
DELETE FROM rf_prod.health WHERE id = 1;

-- Verify with tracing
TRACING ON;
SELECT * FROM rf_prod.health WHERE id = 1;
-- Empty result, but the tombstone exists on disk
TRACING OFF;
```

**Why gc_grace_seconds matters:** If you compact and remove a tombstone before all replicas have seen it, the old data can "resurrect" — reappear on a replica that missed the delete. This is why `gc_grace_seconds` defaults to 10 days: it gives repair enough time to propagate the tombstone everywhere.

---

## Module 12: Lightweight Transactions (LWT)

LWT provides linearizable consistency using the Paxos protocol. Unlike normal writes (which are "last-write-wins"), LWT performs a read-before-write to ensure conditional updates.

```sql
-- Book a seat only if not already taken (compare-and-set)
INSERT INTO rf_prod.tickets (seat_id, owner) VALUES ('A1', 'Alice')
IF NOT EXISTS;

-- Second attempt fails
INSERT INTO rf_prod.tickets (seat_id, owner) VALUES ('A1', 'Bob')
IF NOT EXISTS;
-- Returns: [applied: false, seat_id: 'A1', owner: 'Alice']
```

**Trade-off:** LWT is 4x slower than normal writes due to the Paxos round-trips (Prepare → Promise → Accept → Commit). Use only when correctness requires it (inventory, reservations, counters).

---

## Module 13: Summary & Health Check

A checkpoint module that verifies the cluster is healthy before proceeding to advanced scenarios.

```bash
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool status
# All 6 nodes should show UN (Up/Normal)
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool describecluster
# Schema versions should show a single version across all nodes
```

---

## Module 14: The "Ghost Rack" (Double Rack Failure)

Interactive question: **"Can the cluster still serve reads with 2 of 6 nodes dead?"** — pause — then proves it.

Simulates simultaneous failure of Rack 1 in both DCs — a scenario where 2 of 6 nodes go down at once. With RF=3 and `NetworkTopologyStrategy`, data remains available because each DC still has 2 replicas in Racks 2 and 3.

```text
DC1                          DC2
┌────────┬────────┬────────┐ ┌────────┬────────┬────────┐
│ Rack 1 │ Rack 2 │ Rack 3 │ │ Rack 1 │ Rack 2 │ Rack 3 │
│  DEAD  │   OK   │   OK   │ │  DEAD  │   OK   │   OK   │
│ node1  │ node2  │ node3  │ │ node4  │ node5  │ node6  │
└────────┴────────┴────────┘ └────────┴────────┴────────┘
```

```bash
# Kill Rack 1 in both DCs
docker-compose stop hcd-node1 hcd-node4

# Verify: LOCAL_QUORUM still succeeds (2 of 3 replicas per DC alive)
docker exec hcd-node2 cqlsh -e "CONSISTENCY LOCAL_QUORUM; SELECT count(*) FROM rf_prod.health;"

# Restore
docker-compose start hcd-node1 hcd-node4
```

**Why this works:** `NetworkTopologyStrategy` places one replica per rack. With 3 racks per DC, losing Rack 1 leaves 2 replicas alive — still enough for LOCAL_QUORUM (requires 2 of 3).

---

## Module 15: Schema Disagreement

Interactive question: **"If a node was down during a CREATE TABLE, what happens when it comes back?"** — pause — answer: Gossip propagates schema changes within seconds.

Shows what happens when nodes have different schema versions — typically caused by a schema change that hasn't fully propagated. HCD's gossip protocol detects this and resolves it automatically.

```bash
# Check for schema agreement (most precise method)
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool describecluster | grep -A 5 "Schema versions"

# Cross-check via system.peers
docker exec hcd-node1 cqlsh -e "SELECT peer, schema_version FROM system.peers;"

# If disagreement exists, force schema pull
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool resetlocalschema
```

---

## Module 16: Gossip Protocol Deep Dive

Gossip is HCD's peer-to-peer failure detection and metadata propagation mechanism. Every second, each node picks 1-3 random peers and exchanges state information.

```bash
# View gossip state for all known peers
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool gossipinfo

# Key fields to inspect:
# - HEARTBEAT: incrementing counter (proves node is alive)
# - STATUS: NORMAL, BOOT, LEAVING, etc.
# - DC/RACK: datacenter and rack assignment
# - SCHEMA: schema version hash
```

---

## Module 17: The "Zombie Node" (Network Partition)

Interactive question: **"Can the cluster write while a node is partitioned?"** — pause — then proves it.

Simulates a network partition by disconnecting a node from the Docker network. The node is still running but unreachable — a "zombie" from the cluster's perspective. Gossip will mark it as DOWN.

> **Note:** The script dynamically resolves the Docker network name via `docker network ls --filter "name=hcd-cluster"`. This works regardless of the project directory name.

```bash
# Resolve the network name dynamically
HCD_NETWORK=$(docker network ls --filter "name=hcd-cluster" --format '{{.Name}}' | head -1)

# Partition node2 from the network
docker network disconnect "$HCD_NETWORK" hcd-node2

# Watch gossip detect the failure (takes ~10-30 seconds)
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool status
# node2 transitions from UN to DN

# Heal the partition
docker network connect "$HCD_NETWORK" hcd-node2
# node2 transitions back to UN
```

**What to look for:** After disconnect, `nodetool status` shows node2 as DN (Down/Normal). Writes at LOCAL_QUORUM still succeed because 2 of 3 dc1 replicas remain. After reconnect, node2 returns to UN and receives missed writes via hinted handoff.

## Module 18: Storage Attached Indexing (SAI) - Deep Dive

SAI (Storage Attached Indexing) stores index structures alongside data in SSTables, unlike legacy 2i indexes which maintain separate hidden tables.

### SAI vs Legacy 2i
```text
Legacy 2i:  Data SSTable ──► Separate Hidden Index Table (extra write amplification)
SAI:        Data SSTable ──► Embedded Index Component (collocated, no extra tables)
```

### SAI Architecture
```text
SSTable on Disk
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [ Data Component ]   [ Index Component (SAI) ]                  │
│ Row 1: {id:A, val:1} ──► BitMap/Trie Index (val:1 -> Row A)      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Code Examples
```sql
CREATE TABLE rf_prod.assets (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
    name text,
    category text,
    value int,
    tags map<text, text>
);

CREATE CUSTOM INDEX ON rf_prod.assets (category) USING 'StorageAttachedIndex';
CREATE CUSTOM INDEX ON rf_prod.assets (value) USING 'StorageAttachedIndex';

-- Advanced Indexing (Map Entries & Analyzers)
CREATE CUSTOM INDEX ON rf_prod.assets (ENTRIES(tags)) USING 'StorageAttachedIndex';
CREATE CUSTOM INDEX ON rf_prod.products (name) USING 'StorageAttachedIndex'
WITH OPTIONS = {'case_sensitive': 'false', 'normalize': 'true'};

-- Composable Querying (multiple SAI indexes in one WHERE clause)
SELECT * FROM rf_prod.assets WHERE category = 'hardware' AND value > 1000;

-- Inspect SAI index metadata via virtual tables
SELECT * FROM system_views.indexes;
```

---

## Module 19: JSON & Data API Operations - Deep Dive

HCD's native JSON support provides document-database flexibility with schema enforcement.

### Syntax Reference
```sql
-- Insert
INSERT INTO assets JSON '{"id": "...", "name": "Server-X", "value": 500}';

-- Select
SELECT JSON name, value FROM assets WHERE category = 'hardware';

-- Surgical Updates (Partial JSON — DEFAULT UNSET leaves other columns unchanged)
INSERT INTO assets JSON '{"id": "...", "value": 999}' DEFAULT UNSET;

-- TTL and Batches
INSERT INTO assets JSON '{"id": "...", "name": "Temp"}' USING TTL 3600;
BEGIN BATCH
  INSERT INTO assets JSON '...';
  INSERT INTO assets JSON '...';
APPLY BATCH;
```

### Design Best Practices
1. **Schema First**: Define your table schema precisely.
2. **Collections**: Use Maps and Lists for dynamic data.
3. **Primary Keys**: Must be provided in the JSON object.

---

## Module 20: Vector Search & AI Readiness (SAI Vector)

HCD leverages SAI to provide native Vector Search capabilities, enabling Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and semantic search directly within the database.

### The Vector Data Type
HCD introduces the `vector<float, n>` type (requires HCD 1.2+ with vector support, based on the Cassandra 5.0 vector type). Unlike standard columns, vector columns are searched using Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms via SAI.

> **Compatibility:** If your HCD version doesn't support `vector<float, N>`, the script will detect this and skip the module with a clear message. Check your version with `nodetool version`.

### Code Examples

```sql
-- Create a table for AI embeddings (5-dimensional vectors)
CREATE TABLE rf_prod.documents (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
    title text,
    content text,
    category text,
    embedding vector<float, 5>
);

-- Create a Vector Index with cosine similarity
CREATE CUSTOM INDEX ON rf_prod.documents (embedding)
USING 'StorageAttachedIndex'
WITH OPTIONS = {'similarity_function': 'cosine'};

-- Create a Metadata Index for Hybrid Search
CREATE CUSTOM INDEX ON rf_prod.documents (category)
USING 'StorageAttachedIndex';

-- Semantic Search (find documents similar to a query vector)
SELECT title, content FROM rf_prod.documents
ORDER BY embedding ANN OF [0.9, 0.1, 0.8, 0.2, 0.7]
LIMIT 3;

-- Hybrid Search (Vector + Metadata Filtering)
SELECT title, similarity_cosine(embedding, [0.9, 0.1, 0.8, 0.2, 0.7]) as score
FROM rf_prod.documents
WHERE category = 'tech'
ORDER BY embedding ANN OF [0.9, 0.1, 0.8, 0.2, 0.7]
LIMIT 3;
```

The demo inserts 15 documents across 3 semantic clusters (database, AI/ML, networking) and shows how vector similarity groups them correctly.

---

## Module 21: Mixed Real-time Operations (The Mutation Model)

In HCD, there is no fundamental difference between `INSERT` and `UPDATE` at the storage layer. Both are treated as **Mutations**. This is the key insight that distinguishes HCD from traditional RDBMS.

### The "Upsert" Nature
HCD does not perform a "Read-Before-Write". When you issue an `INSERT` or `UPDATE`, the node simply appends the new data (with a timestamp) to the Memtable. This makes writes incredibly fast.

### Data Resolution (LWW)
During a `SELECT` operation, HCD retrieves all versions of the data from different SSTables and replicas, then applies **Last-Write-Wins (LWW)** logic based on the timestamp to return the correct value.

### Deletes as Writes (Tombstones)
When you `DELETE` data, HCD writes a special marker called a **Tombstone**. This is necessary because HCD is immutable on disk; you cannot "erase" data from an existing SSTable. The Tombstone ensures that older versions of the data (with earlier timestamps) do not reappear during a compaction or read.

### Code Examples
```sql
-- These two are functionally identical if the row exists:
INSERT INTO stream (id, val) VALUES (1, 'A');
UPDATE stream SET val = 'A' WHERE id = 1;

-- Batching different operations together:
BEGIN UNLOGGED BATCH
  INSERT INTO stream (id, val) VALUES (10, 'new');
  UPDATE stream SET val = 'changed' WHERE id = 11;
  DELETE FROM stream WHERE id = 12;
APPLY BATCH;
```

---

## Module 22: Compaction - The Physical Resolution of Entropy

Compaction is the background process that merges SSTables, resolves overwritten values by comparing timestamps (LWW), and physically removes data marked with Tombstones once they have exceeded `gc_grace_seconds`.

In this module, we trigger a manual compaction to see multiple SSTables merge into a single optimized file.

```bash
# View current SSTables
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool cfstats rf_prod.stream

# Force compaction
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool compact rf_prod stream

# Verify SSTable count decreased
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool cfstats rf_prod.stream
```

---

## Module 23: Kill an Entire Datacenter (Multi-DC Failover)

This is the "wow moment" of the demo (~5-8 minutes). We prove zero-downtime cross-DC failover through a 5-step sequence:

```text
Step 1: Insert 20 rows via dc1     Step 2: Kill ALL of dc1
┌──────┐  ┌──────┐                  ┌──────┐  ┌──────┐
│ DC1  │  │ DC2  │                  │ DC1  │  │ DC2  │
│ 20   │──│ 20   │  (replicated)    │ DEAD │  │ 20   │  ← still has all data
│ rows │  │ rows │                  │      │  │ rows │
└──────┘  └──────┘                  └──────┘  └──────┘

Step 3: Read from dc2 (success!)   Step 4: Write 10 new rows from dc2
LOCAL_QUORUM → 20 rows returned     dc2 stores rows 21-30 + hints for dc1

Step 5: Restart dc1
dc1 receives hints → all 30 rows on all nodes
```

```sql
-- Create test table
CREATE TABLE rf_prod.dc_failover (id int PRIMARY KEY, msg text, written_from text);

-- Insert 20 rows from dc1
INSERT INTO rf_prod.dc_failover (id, msg, written_from) VALUES (1, 'row-1', 'dc1');
-- ... (20 rows total)

-- Kill dc1: docker-compose stop hcd-node1 hcd-node2 hcd-node3

-- Read from dc2 (all data present)
CONSISTENCY LOCAL_QUORUM; SELECT count(*) FROM rf_prod.dc_failover;

-- Write from dc2 during outage
INSERT INTO rf_prod.dc_failover (id, msg, written_from) VALUES (21, 'during-outage', 'dc2');

-- Restore dc1: docker-compose start hcd-node1 hcd-node2 hcd-node3
-- dc1 sees all data including rows written during outage
```

---

## Module 24: Grand Finale - The Self-Healing Database

Three escalating failure scenarios demonstrating HCD's resilience:

| Act | Failure | Resolution | Proof |
|-----|---------|------------|-------|
| 1 | Kill node3 | Hinted Handoff | Row count match after restart |
| 2 | Kill entire dc1 | Cross-DC reads | LOCAL_QUORUM from dc2 |
| 3 | Restore dc1 + repair | Anti-Entropy Repair | All nodes UN, full row count |

---

## Module 25: CDC (Change Data Capture)

CDC captures every mutation as an event for downstream systems. When enabled on a table, every write is recorded to commitlog segments in `/var/lib/cassandra/cdc_raw/`, ready for consumption by event pipelines.

### Prerequisites
CDC must be enabled globally in `cassandra.yaml` (`cdc_enabled: true`) and per-table (`WITH cdc = true`). The demo cluster has CDC pre-enabled in the configuration template.

### CDC Segment Inspection
The demo uses `strings` to peek at raw CDC segment contents, proving mutations are captured at the binary level:
```bash
docker exec hcd-node1 bash -c "strings /var/lib/cassandra/cdc_raw/*.log 2>/dev/null | grep -i cdc | head -5"
```

### Architecture
```text
Client Write ──► Memtable ──► CommitLog ──► CDC Segment
                                              │
                                              ▼
                                    /var/lib/cassandra/cdc_raw/
                                              │
                                              ▼
                                    External Consumer (Kafka, Pulsar, etc.)
```

### Code Examples
```sql
-- Create a CDC-enabled table
CREATE TABLE rf_prod.events (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
    event_type text,
    payload text
) WITH cdc = true;

-- Write events (automatically captured to CDC segments)
INSERT INTO rf_prod.events (id, event_type, payload)
VALUES (uuid(), 'user_signup', '{"email": "alice@example.com"}');

-- Verify CDC is active on the table
SELECT table_name, cdc FROM system_schema.tables
WHERE keyspace_name = 'rf_prod' AND table_name = 'events';
```

```bash
# Check CDC segments on disk
docker exec hcd-node1 ls -la /var/lib/cassandra/cdc_raw/
```

**What to look for:** After writing events, new segment files appear in `cdc_raw/`. In production, a CDC consumer (like Debezium or a custom reader) would process and delete these segments.

---

## Module 26: Audit Logging

Enterprise audit logging tracks all CQL operations for compliance. HCD can log every SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE to a file, with filtering by category, keyspace, or user.

### Prerequisites
Audit logging is configured in `cassandra.yaml` under `audit_logging_options` but disabled by default. It is enabled/disabled at runtime via `nodetool`. The demo pre-checks `cassandra.yaml` for the `audit_logging_options` section and searches multiple log directories (`/var/log/cassandra/`, `/opt/hcd/logs/`) for audit output.

### Usage
```bash
# Enable audit logging
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool enableauditlog

# Run some operations that will be captured
docker exec hcd-node1 cqlsh -e "SELECT * FROM rf_prod.health;"
docker exec hcd-node1 cqlsh -e "INSERT INTO rf_prod.health (id, status) VALUES (999, 'audit-test');"

# Check audit logs
docker exec hcd-node1 cat /var/lib/cassandra/audit/audit.log

# Disable audit logging
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool disableauditlog
```

### What gets logged
| Category | Operations | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| QUERY | SELECT statements | `SELECT * FROM rf_prod.health` |
| DML | INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE | `INSERT INTO rf_prod.health ...` |
| DDL | CREATE, ALTER, DROP | `CREATE TABLE rf_prod.new_table ...` |
| AUTH | LOGIN, permission changes | `GRANT SELECT ON rf_prod.health TO user` |

**What to look for:** The audit log shows timestamped entries with the CQL statement, source IP, keyspace, and operation category. This is essential for SOC2/HIPAA compliance.

---

## Module 27: Guardrails

HCD guardrails prevent common anti-patterns that cause performance degradation or outages in production. They act as safety nets configured via `cassandra.yaml`.

### Key Guardrails

| Guardrail | Warn Threshold | Fail Threshold | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| Batch size | 5 KB | 50 KB | Prevent coordinator overload |
| Collection size | 100 KB | -- | Prevent partition bloat |
| Tables per keyspace | 150 | -- | Prevent metadata bloat |
| Columns per table | 100 | -- | Prevent wide-row anti-patterns |
| Unlogged batch across partitions | 10 | -- | Prevent scatter-gather batches |

```bash
# View current guardrail configuration
docker exec hcd-node1 grep -i 'warn_threshold\|fail_threshold' \
  /opt/hcd/resources/cassandra/conf/cassandra.yaml
```

```sql
-- Trigger a batch size warning (intentionally large batch of 50 rows)
BEGIN UNLOGGED BATCH
  INSERT INTO rf_prod.health (id, status) VALUES (1000, 'guardrail-test-1');
  -- ... 49 more rows ...
APPLY BATCH;
```

**What to look for:** The batch triggers a WARN log message if it exceeds 5KB or a failure if it exceeds 50KB. Check `docker-compose logs hcd-node1` for "Batch ... is too large" warnings.

---

## Module 28: Data Modeling Anti-Patterns

The #1 mistake in Cassandra/HCD is poor partition key design. A bad key creates "hot partitions" — a single node drowning in traffic while others sit idle.

```text
BAD:  PRIMARY KEY (date)              → All writes for one day hit ONE partition
GOOD: PRIMARY KEY ((date, bucket), ts) → Writes spread across N buckets per day
```

The demo inserts 200 rows with 500-byte payloads to make hot partition effects visible, then compares with a bucketed design.

> **Production context:** In real systems, hot partitions involve 500M+ rows and 80GB+ partitions. The 200-row demo uses the same mechanics at observable scale.

```sql
-- Bad model: single partition per day
CREATE TABLE rf_prod.bad_model (
    date text, event_id timeuuid, data text,
    PRIMARY KEY (date, event_id)
);

-- Good model: bucketed partitions
CREATE TABLE rf_prod.good_model (
    date text, bucket int, event_id timeuuid, data text,
    PRIMARY KEY ((date, bucket), event_id)
);
```

**What to look for:** Compare `nodetool tablestats` — the bad model has one massive partition; the good model spreads data across 5 smaller partitions. Rule of thumb: keep partitions under 100MB and 100K rows.

---

## Module 29: Latency Comparison

Traces the same write at three consistency levels to show the latency/availability trade-off.

```sql
TRACING ON;
CONSISTENCY ONE;
INSERT INTO rf_prod.health (id, status) VALUES (200, 'cl-one');
-- Fastest: only 1 replica ack needed

CONSISTENCY LOCAL_QUORUM;
INSERT INTO rf_prod.health (id, status) VALUES (201, 'cl-lq');
-- Medium: 2 of 3 local replicas

CONSISTENCY EACH_QUORUM;
INSERT INTO rf_prod.health (id, status) VALUES (202, 'cl-eq');
-- Slowest: quorum in EVERY DC (WAN latency)
TRACING OFF;
```

The demo also traces **reads** at CL=ONE, LOCAL_QUORUM, and ALL to show latency differences:

**What to look for:** The demo extracts `Request complete` timing from each trace and displays a side-by-side comparison box. Writes use EACH_QUORUM (valid for writes, requires quorum in every DC). Reads use ALL (waits for all 6 replicas) since EACH_QUORUM is write-only in Cassandra. ONE completes in microseconds, LOCAL_QUORUM in low milliseconds, ALL/EACH_QUORUM adds WAN round-trip time.

---

## Module 30: Time-Series Data Modeling

Demonstrates proper time-series design with compound partition keys, TTL, and windowed queries.

```sql
CREATE TABLE rf_prod.sensor_data (
    sensor_id text,
    day_bucket text,
    ts timestamp,
    value double,
    PRIMARY KEY ((sensor_id, day_bucket), ts)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (ts DESC)
  AND default_time_to_live = 86400;
```

**What to look for:** Each sensor+day combination is a bounded partition. TTL auto-expires old data. Queries within a day-bucket are efficient sequential reads.

---

## Module 31: Compaction Deep Dive

Creates four tables with different compaction strategies and compares their SSTable behavior.

```text
STCS (Size-Tiered)     LCS (Leveled)          TWCS (Time-Window)     UCS (Unified)
┌───┐ ┌───┐ ┌───┐     L0: ┌─┐┌─┐┌─┐         Window 1: ┌───────┐   Adaptive hybrid
│ S │ │ M │ │ L │     L1: ┌──────────┐       Window 2: ┌───────┐   that auto-tunes
└───┘ └───┘ └───┘     L2: ┌────────────────┐  Window 3: ┌───────┐   based on workload
Similar sizes merge     Fixed-size levels     Time-bounded windows
Best: write-heavy      Best: read-heavy       Best: TTL/time-series   Best: mixed/default
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE rf_prod.compact_stcs (...) WITH compaction = {'class': 'SizeTieredCompactionStrategy'};
CREATE TABLE rf_prod.compact_lcs  (...) WITH compaction = {'class': 'LeveledCompactionStrategy'};
CREATE TABLE rf_prod.compact_twcs (...) WITH compaction = {'class': 'TimeWindowCompactionStrategy', 'compaction_window_size': '1', 'compaction_window_unit': 'MINUTES'};
CREATE TABLE rf_prod.compact_ucs  (...) WITH compaction = {'class': 'UnifiedCompactionStrategy'};
```

**What to look for:** After inserting data and flushing, compare SSTable counts and sizes via `nodetool tablestats`. STCS accumulates more SSTables; LCS maintains fixed-size levels; TWCS groups by time window.

---

## Module 32: Compression Strategies

Compares on-disk compression algorithms and their trade-offs.

| Algorithm | Ratio | Speed | CPU | Use Case |
|-----------|-------|-------|-----|----------|
| LZ4 | Good | Fastest | Low | Default, general purpose |
| Zstd | Best | Medium | Medium | Cold data, archival |
| Snappy | Good | Fast | Low | Legacy compatibility |
| None | 1:1 | N/A | None | Already-compressed data |

```sql
CREATE TABLE rf_prod.comp_lz4    (...) WITH compression = {'sstable_compression': 'LZ4Compressor'};
CREATE TABLE rf_prod.comp_zstd   (...) WITH compression = {'sstable_compression': 'ZstdCompressor'};
CREATE TABLE rf_prod.comp_snappy (...) WITH compression = {'sstable_compression': 'SnappyCompressor'};
CREATE TABLE rf_prod.comp_none   (...) WITH compression = {'enabled': 'false'};
```

**What to look for:** After inserting identical data into all four tables and flushing, compare `Space used (live)` from `nodetool tablestats`. Zstd typically achieves the best compression ratio; uncompressed is largest.

> **Production context:** A 1TB dataset typically compresses to 400-600GB with Zstd, significantly reducing storage costs and I/O amplification during compaction.

---

## Module 33: Live Failover Under Load

Writes data continuously, kills a node mid-stream, then verifies zero data loss (~5 minutes).

1. Insert 50 rows via dc1
2. Kill node3 mid-stream (after row 25)
3. Continue writing rows 26-50
4. Restart node3
5. Verify all 50 rows present

**What to look for:** All 50 rows survive despite the failure. Hinted handoff delivers missed writes to node3 after restart.

---

## Module 34: Multi-DC Write Conflict

Writes the same row from both datacenters simultaneously, then shows Last-Write-Wins resolution using two strategies.

### Strategy 1: Parallel Shell Writes
```bash
# Concurrent writes from dc1 and dc2 (shell & for parallelism)
docker exec hcd-node1 cqlsh -e "INSERT INTO rf_prod.conflict_test ..." &
docker exec hcd-node4 cqlsh -e "INSERT INTO rf_prod.conflict_test ..." &
wait
```

### Strategy 2: Deterministic Proof with USING TIMESTAMP
```sql
-- dc1 write with explicit timestamp
INSERT INTO rf_prod.conflict_test (id, val, source) VALUES (1, 'dc1-wins', 'dc1') USING TIMESTAMP 1000;
-- dc2 write with higher timestamp (guaranteed winner)
INSERT INTO rf_prod.conflict_test (id, val, source) VALUES (1, 'dc2-wins', 'dc2') USING TIMESTAMP 2000;

-- Check which write won:
SELECT val, source, WRITETIME(val) FROM rf_prod.conflict_test WHERE id = 1;
```

**What to look for:** The row with the higher `WRITETIME()` wins. There is no merge — it's pure Last-Write-Wins. Strategy 2 uses `USING TIMESTAMP` for a deterministic proof independent of network timing.

---

## Module 35: Adding a Datacenter Live

Demonstrates the full workflow for expanding a cluster with a new datacenter without downtime.

```text
Step 1: ALTER KEYSPACE to include new DC
Step 2: nodetool rebuild on new nodes (streams data from existing DCs)
Step 3: nodetool cleanup on old nodes (reclaims space from moved ranges)
```

```sql
-- Add dc2 to a dc1-only keyspace
ALTER KEYSPACE rf_low WITH replication = {
    'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'dc1': 3, 'dc2': 3
};
```

```bash
# Stream data to dc2 nodes
docker exec hcd-node4 nodetool rebuild -- dc1
# Clean up old nodes
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool cleanup rf_low
```

**What to look for:** During rebuild, `nodetool netstats` shows streaming progress. After rebuild completes, data is queryable from dc2 nodes. Cleanup on dc1 nodes reclaims space from token ranges that moved.

---

## Module 36: Backup & Restore

Demonstrates the snapshot-based backup and restore workflow.

```bash
# Take a snapshot
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool snapshot rf_prod -t backup1

# Verify snapshot exists
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool listsnapshots

# Simulate disaster: TRUNCATE the table
docker exec hcd-node1 cqlsh -e "TRUNCATE rf_prod.health;"

# Restore: copy snapshot SSTables back and refresh
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool refresh rf_prod health
```

**What to look for:** After TRUNCATE, the table is empty. After restoring from snapshot and running `nodetool refresh`, all data reappears. In production, you'd copy snapshots to external storage (S3, NFS) for disaster recovery.

---

## Module 37: Rolling Restart

Demonstrates zero-downtime node-by-node restart of ALL nodes (including the seed) while verifying reads and writes succeed throughout (~8-10 minutes).

**Restart order:** Non-seed nodes first (node3, node2), seed node last (node1). Seed nodes should be restarted last because other nodes use seeds for initial bootstrap, but once running, gossip maintains the cluster independently.

```bash
# Restart node3 (non-seed), verify writes work
docker-compose stop hcd-node3
docker exec hcd-node1 cqlsh -e "CONSISTENCY LOCAL_QUORUM; INSERT INTO rf_prod.rolling_test ...;"
docker-compose start hcd-node3
# Wait for UN...

# Restart node2 (non-seed), verify writes work
docker-compose stop hcd-node2
docker exec hcd-node1 cqlsh -e "CONSISTENCY LOCAL_QUORUM; INSERT INTO rf_prod.rolling_test ...;"
docker-compose start hcd-node2
# Wait for UN...

# Restart node1 (SEED — last), verify writes work from node2
docker-compose stop hcd-node1
docker exec hcd-node2 cqlsh -e "CONSISTENCY LOCAL_QUORUM; INSERT INTO rf_prod.rolling_test ...;"
docker-compose start hcd-node1
# Wait for UN...
```

**What to look for:** 20 total rows (5 initial + 5 per restart phase). Reads and writes succeed at LOCAL_QUORUM throughout, including while the seed node is down. The cluster is NEVER unavailable.

---

## Module 38: Rate Limiting & Thread Pools

Monitors HCD's internal thread pools and latency histograms to understand resource utilization.

```bash
# View thread pool statistics
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool tpstats

# View read/write latency histograms
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool proxyhistograms

# Key thread pools:
# - ReadStage: handles read requests
# - MutationStage: handles writes
# - CompactionExecutor: runs compactions
# - GossipStage: peer communication
```

**What to look for:** `Pending` column shows queued tasks (indicates overload). `All time blocked` indicates thread pool exhaustion. Healthy systems show 0 pending and 0 blocked.

---

## Module 39: Repair Strategies

Compares different repair approaches and their trade-offs.

| Strategy | Scope | Speed | I/O Impact | Use Case |
|----------|-------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Full repair | All ranges | Slow | High | After long outage |
| Primary-range (-pr) | Owned ranges | Medium | Medium | Regular maintenance |
| Incremental | Changed data | Fast | Low | Frequent runs |

```bash
# Full repair (repairs all ranges — use sparingly)
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool repair rf_prod

# Primary-range repair (preferred for regular maintenance)
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool repair -pr rf_prod

# Check repair history
docker exec hcd-node1 cqlsh -e "SELECT * FROM system_distributed.repair_history LIMIT 5;"
```

**What to look for:** Repair output shows Merkle tree comparisons between replicas. `repair_history` table records when each repair ran and which ranges were repaired.

---

## Module 40: Stress Testing

Rapid-fire writes (200 rows) with nanosecond timing to observe latency distribution and storage engine behavior under load.

```bash
# Insert 200 rows rapidly with timing
for i in $(seq 1 200); do
    docker exec hcd-node1 cqlsh -e "INSERT INTO rf_prod.health (id, status) VALUES ($((5000+i)), 'stress-$i');"
done

# Check latency histogram
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool proxyhistograms

# Check bloom filter effectiveness
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool tablestats rf_prod.health | grep -i bloom
```

> **Production benchmark context:** Single-node throughput typically reaches 10K-50K ops/sec; cluster-wide throughput 50K-200K ops/sec depending on hardware, data model, and consistency level.

**What to look for:** Proxyhistograms show p50/p99 latencies. Bloom filter stats show false-positive ratio — a high ratio indicates too many SSTables (needs compaction).

---

## Module 41: Security & Access Control

Demonstrates role-based access control (RBAC) concepts.

> **Note:** This demo cluster uses `AllowAllAuthenticator` (default). The commands below demonstrate RBAC syntax. In production, enable `PasswordAuthenticator` in `cassandra.yaml` before roles enforce real access control.

```sql
-- Create non-login roles (permission groups)
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS demo_reader WITH LOGIN = false;
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS demo_writer WITH LOGIN = false;

-- Grant permissions
GRANT SELECT ON KEYSPACE rf_prod TO demo_reader;
GRANT MODIFY ON KEYSPACE rf_prod TO demo_writer;

-- View permissions
LIST ALL PERMISSIONS OF demo_reader;
LIST ALL PERMISSIONS OF demo_writer;
```

**What to look for:** `demo_reader` has SELECT only; `demo_writer` has MODIFY only. In production: enable `PasswordAuthenticator` and `CassandraAuthorizer` in `cassandra.yaml`, create login roles with passwords, and enable TLS for client-to-node and node-to-node encryption.

---

## Module 42: Geographic Visualization

Maps data placement to physical nodes, proving LOCAL_QUORUM avoids WAN round-trips.

```bash
# Show which nodes hold a specific partition
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool getendpoints rf_prod health 1
# Returns 6 IPs (3 per DC with RF=3)

# View the full ring structure
docker exec hcd-node1 nodetool describering rf_prod
```

```sql
-- Trace a LOCAL_QUORUM read to prove no WAN hops
TRACING ON;
CONSISTENCY LOCAL_QUORUM;
SELECT * FROM rf_prod.health WHERE id = 1;
TRACING OFF;
```

**What to look for:** The trace shows all coordination happens within the local DC — no messages to dc2 IPs (172.28.0.5-7). `getendpoints` confirms data exists on 6 nodes but LOCAL_QUORUM only contacts 3 local ones.

## Module 43: Driver Policies — The Client-Side of Entropy

Until now, every command used `cqlsh` — a single-node CLI tool. In production, applications use the DataStax Python/Java/Go driver with **smart routing policies** that are fundamental to entropy management.

### Key Policies

| Policy | What it Does | Entropy Impact |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| `RoundRobinPolicy` | Picks coordinators in rotation | Naive — extra hop to actual replica |
| `DCAwareRoundRobinPolicy` | Keeps traffic in local DC | Avoids WAN, reduces cross-DC entropy |
| `TokenAwarePolicy` | Routes to owning replica | Zero coordinator hop — minimum latency |

### How TokenAwarePolicy Works

```text
NAIVE ROUND-ROBIN (cqlsh)            TOKEN-AWARE (DataStax Driver)

Client ──► node1 ─────► node3       Client ──► node3 (direct!)
       (coordinator)  (replica)           (coordinator IS the replica)

Extra hop: coordinator must           Zero extra hops: the driver
forward to the actual replica.        KNOWS the token ring and sends
                                      the request straight to the owner.
```

1. Driver connects → downloads token ring from `system.peers`
2. For each write, driver hashes the partition key (Murmur3)
3. Maps hash → owning node from the ring
4. Sends write directly to that node

### Code Example

```python
from cassandra.cluster import Cluster
from cassandra.policies import DCAwareRoundRobinPolicy, TokenAwarePolicy

cluster = Cluster(
    ['172.28.0.2', '172.28.0.3', '172.28.0.4'],
    load_balancing_policy=TokenAwarePolicy(
        DCAwareRoundRobinPolicy(local_dc='dc1')
    ),
)
session = cluster.connect('rf_prod')
# Every write goes directly to the replica that owns the partition
result = session.execute("INSERT INTO health (id, status) VALUES (%s, %s)", (1, 'ok'))
print(result.response_future.coordinator_host)  # Shows the owning replica
```

**What to look for:** RoundRobin spreads writes across ALL nodes (including non-replicas). TokenAware targets writes to replica owners — fewer distinct coordinators, lower latency.

---

## Module 44: Speculative Execution — Masking Latency Spikes

In a distributed system, any replica can become temporarily slow (compaction, GC pause, disk I/O). Speculative execution sends **backup requests** to mask these latency spikes.

### Timeline

```text
WITHOUT SPECULATIVE:
Client ──req──► Replica A ────────────(slow)─────────► response
                                                p99 = slow node

WITH SPECULATIVE (delay=200ms):
Client ──req──► Replica A ────(slow, no response yet)────►
        │
        ╰─ 200ms ─► Replica B ──(fast)──► response (WINS!)

Whichever replica responds FIRST is used. The slow one is ignored.
p99 ≈ p50 because you're racing multiple replicas!
```

### Trade-offs

| | Without | With Speculative |
|---|---------|-----------------|
| p99 latency | High (slowest replica) | Low (≈ p50) |
| Network traffic | Normal | Slightly higher |
| Best for | Simple workloads | Latency-sensitive reads/writes |
| Avoid with | — | LWT (Paxos is not idempotent) |

### Code Example

```python
from cassandra.policies import ConstantSpeculativeExecutionPolicy

cluster = Cluster(
    contact_points,
    speculative_execution_policy=ConstantSpeculativeExecutionPolicy(
        delay=0.2,        # 200ms before sending backup
        max_attempts=2,   # up to 2 backup requests
    ),
)
```

**What to look for:** Compare p99 latencies between runs with and without speculative execution. With speculative enabled, p99 drops closer to p50 because slow replicas are masked.

---

## Module 45: Live DC Failover with Driver

Module 23 proved zero-downtime failover using `cqlsh` pointed at a dc2 node. In production, **the application never switches nodes manually** — the DataStax driver does it automatically (~3-5 minutes including DC restart).

### Failover Timeline

```text
T=0s    App writes via driver (local_dc='dc1')
        Coordinators: 172.28.0.2, .3, .4 (dc1 nodes)

T=15s   ██ ALL DC1 NODES KILLED ██
        Driver detects dc1 is down via connection monitoring

T=16s   Driver AUTOMATICALLY routes to dc2 (used_hosts_per_remote_dc=3)
        Coordinators: 172.28.0.5, .6, .7 (dc2 nodes)
        >>> ZERO application errors, ZERO code changes <<<

T=35s   DC1 restarted
        Driver detects dc1 is back, routes traffic home
        Coordinators: back to 172.28.0.2, .3, .4
```

### Critical Configuration

```python
DCAwareRoundRobinPolicy(
    local_dc='dc1',
    used_hosts_per_remote_dc=3,  # ← MUST be > 0 for cross-DC failover!
)
# Default is 0 — the driver will REFUSE to failover without this!
```

### What the Demo Shows

1. Start continuous writer on hcd-node4 (dc2) with `local_dc='dc1'`
2. Kill all dc1 nodes (`docker-compose stop hcd-node1 hcd-node2 hcd-node3`)
3. Driver automatically routes to dc2 — zero errors
4. Restart dc1 — driver routes traffic back home

**What to look for:** The `[WRITE]` output shows coordinator shifting from dc1 IPs to dc2 IPs and back. The `◄── FAILOVER` and `◄── FAILBACK` markers show the exact moments. The summary shows ZERO application errors.

---

## Module 46: Retry Policies Under Partition

When a node times out or becomes unavailable, the driver's **retry policy** decides what happens next: retry on same host, retry on next host, or throw to the application.

### Decision Tree

```text
Write/Read Timeout or Unavailable Exception
│
├── DefaultRetryPolicy
│   └── Enough replicas responded?
│       ├── YES → RETRY on SAME host (once)
│       └── NO  → RETHROW to application
│
├── FallthroughRetryPolicy
│   └── ALWAYS → RETHROW (never retry, never mask errors)
│   Use case: financial transactions, audit trails
│
└── Custom AggressiveRetryPolicy
    └── Attempts < 3?
        ├── YES → RETRY on NEXT host (try another replica)
        └── NO  → RETHROW
    Use case: IoT telemetry, logging, best-effort writes
```

### When to Use Each

| Policy | Use Case | Trade-off |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| DefaultRetryPolicy | General purpose | Balanced retry/visibility |
| FallthroughRetryPolicy | Financial, compliance | Every error visible to app |
| Custom Aggressive | IoT, telemetry, logging | Max availability, some masking |

### Code Example

```python
from cassandra.policies import RetryPolicy

class AggressiveRetryPolicy(RetryPolicy):
    def on_write_timeout(self, query, consistency, write_type,
                         required_responses, received_responses, retry_num):
        if retry_num < 3:
            return self.RETRY_NEXT_HOST, consistency
        return self.RETHROW, None
```

### Dual-Failure Setup
The script uses TWO isolation techniques to reliably trigger retries:
1. `docker pause hcd-node3` — freezes the process (simulates a hung/slow node, causes timeouts)
2. `docker network disconnect` — isolates node2 (simulates network partition, causes unavailable errors)

This ensures the driver encounters both timeout and unavailable exceptions, making the retry policy behavior clearly visible.

**What to look for:** Compare success/failure counts across the three policies. FallthroughRetryPolicy shows more failures (no retries). AggressiveRetryPolicy shows more successes (retries on next host). DefaultRetryPolicy provides a balanced middle ground.

## Module 48: ACID vs HCD — What 'Transactions' Really Mean Here

Compares the traditional RDBMS ACID model with HCD's consistency model:
- **Atomicity**: Per-partition only (no multi-partition rollback)
- **Consistency**: Tunable per query (CL=ONE through ALL)
- **Isolation**: None in the RDBMS sense. LWT provides row-level compare-and-swap (CAS), NOT multi-row transactions. There are no "isolation levels" in Cassandra.
- **Durability**: Full (CommitLog + RF=3)

Demonstrates the consistency spectrum with traced writes at CL=ONE, LOCAL_QUORUM, and LWT, showing increasing latency for increasing guarantees.

**What to look for:** Compare trace latency across the three levels. LWT shows Paxos phases (Prepare/Promise/Accept/Commit). CL=ONE is fastest but weakest. LOCAL_QUORUM is the recommended default.

---

## Module 49: LOGGED vs UNLOGGED BATCH — Atomicity Without Isolation

Explains the batchlog mechanism for crash-safe cross-partition atomicity:
- **UNLOGGED BATCH**: For same-partition mutations (atomic at storage layer, no overhead)
- **LOGGED BATCH**: For cross-partition mutations (batchlog on 2 peers ensures replay on crash)
- **Anti-pattern**: Demonstrates why large batches are dangerous for performance

Uses tracing to show the "Storing batchlog" and "Removing batchlog" steps in LOGGED batches. Includes a 50-row batch anti-pattern demo with tpstats comparison.

**What to look for:** UNLOGGED trace has no batchlog entries. LOGGED trace shows batchlog overhead (~30%). The large batch shows MutationStage pressure in tpstats.

---

## Module 50: The Lost Update Problem — Why Read-Modify-Write Needs LWT

The most dangerous consistency bug demonstrated live:
1. **Lost update**: Two concurrent updates to the same account balance — expected 180, actual 130 or 150
2. **Fix with LWT**: IF conditions provide compare-and-swap (CAS). Second update gets `[applied]: False` with current value for retry
3. **SERIAL vs LOCAL_SERIAL**: Global vs DC-local Paxos consistency for LWT reads

**What to look for:** The non-LWT parallel writes produce a lost update (one value overwrites the other). The LWT version rejects the stale write with `[applied]: False` and returns current values for retry. This is the foundation for Module 51's banking pattern.

---

## Module 51: Banking — Instant Payment Between Two Banks

Real-world cross-partition payment pattern: Alice (Bank A, dc1) pays Bob (Bank B, dc2) $100.

**Pattern**: LWT debit (IF balance >= amount AND version = N) → CDC-enabled payment record → LWT credit (IF version = N) → status update to COMPLETED.

**Failure scenarios demonstrated**:
- Duplicate debit attempt (version guard prevents double-debit, `[applied]: False`)
- Insufficient funds (balance guard rejects overdraft, `[applied]: False`)
- CDC captures payment events for downstream processing

**What to look for:** Total money in system is always conserved (500+200 = 400+300 = 700). LWT prevents double-processing. Version columns provide idempotency.

---

## Module 52: Saga Pattern — Supplier/Customer Order Flow

Multi-step business workflow with compensating transactions:

**Happy path** (ORD-001): Place order → Reserve inventory (LWT) → Capture payment (LWT IF NOT EXISTS) → Ship → SHIPPED

**Failure path** (ORD-002): Place order → Reserve inventory (LWT) → Payment FAILS → **Compensate**: release inventory (LWT) → CANCELLED

Each saga step uses LWT with version guards for idempotency. CDC on the orders table triggers subsequent steps in production.

**What to look for:** Each LWT returns `[applied]: True/False`. When payment fails, the compensating transaction releases reserved inventory back. Final state shows no inventory leak and no data corruption.

---

## Module 53: Consistency Decision Framework

The capstone module presents four sections with pauses between each for discussion:

1. **Decision tree** — flowchart from "single partition?" to pattern selection
2. **Pattern comparison matrix** — latency, throughput, atomicity, isolation
3. **Five golden rules** — actionable defaults
4. **Use case mapping** — pattern per real-world scenario with module references

| Pattern | Latency | Throughput | Atomicity | CAS Scope |
|---------|---------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| LOCAL_QUORUM | ~2ms | Highest | Per-write | None |
| UNLOGGED BATCH | ~2ms | High | Partition | None |
| LOGGED BATCH | ~3ms | Medium | Cross-ptn | None |
| LWT (Paxos) | ~8-15ms | Low | Row-level | Row-level CAS |
| Saga (LWT+CDC) | ~50ms+ | Lowest | Workflow | Per-step CAS |

**Five Golden Rules**: (1) Default to LOCAL_QUORUM, (2) LWT only for race-critical ops, (3) Batches for atomicity not performance, (4) Sagas for business workflows, (5) Design for idempotency first.

## Appendix B: Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| "Cluster nodes are not responding" | Cluster not started | `make up` |
| Node stuck at DN after restart | Slow gossip convergence | Wait 30s; check `nodetool gossipinfo` |
| Read repair not triggering | Data already consistent | Stop a node, write data, restart, then read to force mismatch |
| Hints not replaying | Node was down > 3 hours | Run `nodetool repair -pr <keyspace>` instead |
| Module 17 network disconnect fails | Docker network name mismatch | Check `docker network ls` (usually `brokk_hcd-cluster`) |
| Audit log empty after enableauditlog | Need CQL after enabling | Run queries AFTER `nodetool enableauditlog` |
| Guardrail warnings not appearing | Batch too small to trigger | Increase batch to > 5KB (50+ rows with data) |
| Single-module fails on missing keyspace | Prerequisites not met | Script auto-creates `rf_prod` for Module > 1; verify cluster is running |
